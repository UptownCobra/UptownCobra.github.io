 ## Not Finished
 This is curently a work in progress. You can play a complete game if you are honest and follow the rules of chess on your own. I am actively working on completeling this project.
 
 ## Know Issues
 1. Piece Know their valid moves but cannot see the board, so a bishop, rook, or queen can move straigh through a piece.
 2. King and Rook cannot castle.
 3. The game does not end if the King is taken.
 4. Do not have En Passant programmed in yet.
 5. Do not have Pawn promotion programmed yet.
